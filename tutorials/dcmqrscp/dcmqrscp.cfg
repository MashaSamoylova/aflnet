HostTable BEGIN
#
# The HostTable defines symbolic names for collections of network
# DICOM Application Entities. A symbolic name can represent a single
# application entity or it can represent a group of application entities.
# Each DICOM application entity is defined by a triple consisting of
# Application Entity Title, host name and TCP/IP port number.
#
# Entry Format: SymbolicName = ( AETitle, HostName, Portnumber ), ... |
# SymbolicName = SymbolicName, ...
#
# NOTE: in the current implementation you cannot substitute an IP address
# for a hostname.
#
# Example:
#acme1 = (ANY, localhost, 5678)
#acme2 = (ACME2, acmehost2, 5678)
#acmeCTcompany = acme1
#united1 = (UNITED1, unitedhost1, 104)
#united2 = (UNITED2, unitedhost2, 104)
#unitedMRcompany = united1, united2
#
HostTable END
VendorTable BEGIN
#
# The VendorTable is used by the dcmqrdb and dcmqrti applications.
# You can give a vendor name (r.h.s. entry below) to the dcmqrti
# program and it will talk to all hosts and AEs of the vendor.
# The dcmqrdb program can use the vendor table to restrict move destination
# to hosts belonging to a vendor.
# Also, the dcmqrti and dcmqrdb programs use the name defined on the left hand side
# as the vendor name to display above images.
#
# The format:
# VendorName = SymbolicName
# The symbolic name should be defined in the HostTable.
#
# Example:
#"Acme CT Company" = acmeCTcompany
#"United MR Company" = unitedMRcompany
#
VendorTable END
AETable BEGIN
#
# Each row of the AETable defines an Application Entities (AE) Title known
# to the dcmqrdb application. Each AE Title represents a separate
# image database located in the specified file system directory (storage area).
# Each AE Title has read/write, quota and peer access restrictions.
#
# Entry Format: AETitle StorageArea Access Quota Peers
# AccessFormat: R | RW | W
# Quota Format: ( maxStudies, maxBytesPerStudy )
# Peers Format: ( Hostname, AETitle, Portnumber ), ... |
# Entry in HostTable |
# ANY
# Example:
#
ACME_STORE <put $WORK value here>/dcmtk/build/bin/ACME_STORE RW (9, 1024mb) ANY
UNITED_STORE <put $WORK value here>/dcmtk/build/bin/UNITED_STORE RW (9, 1024mb) ANY
ANY-SCP <put $WORK value here>/dcmtk/build/bin/ACME_STORE RW (9, 1024mb) ANY

# Uncomment and adjust the following lines for a common r/rw storage area:
#READWRITE /var/lib/dcmtk/db/READWRITE RW (10, 1024mb) ANY
